Lets start building ðŸš€

### Prerequisites

- You should have completed the [Whitelist dApp tutorial](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp)

### Theory

- What is a Non-Fungible Token?
  Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable eg Eth is fungible. With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. Every single token has unique characteristics and values. They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable eg Unique Art

- What is ERC-721?
  ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs. Before moving ahead have a look at all the functions supported by [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721)
